-We decide to create a website. The website should be an additional tool to help children learn.
-We therefore decided to create an interactive website, with an exchange between the child and the computer. So it should be easy to use.
 We must also attribute an additional conclusion for the  parents or teachers on the difficulty of the child.
 It was therefore necessary to set up a system with exercice and test for control the child achievement.
-This project brings a way to make a site, it is not the best possible but it works.
